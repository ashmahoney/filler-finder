      https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/directions

      Fix minimap on description.html to recenter on the clicked marker

      Pass templateVars to html, use js to get vars from html
      put list of Fillers into templateVars and passs that into home.html
      Use jinja to do a script loop to create all the markers, and be clickable

      Problem is js <--> python, not python --> html
