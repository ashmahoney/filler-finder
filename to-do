      Implement filtering for locations https://appendto.com/2016/09/advanced-google-maps-with-javascript-filtering-and-displaying-information/

✓     Add a way for users to input custom filler location

      Make it so that users need to sign in/have an account in order to add filler

      Sign-in page (users have to sign in in order to add filler)

      Put minimap focused on filler on description page after clicking on marker

      Get directions to filler

      Fix minimap on description.html to recenter on the clicked marker

Pass templateVars to html, use js to get vars from html
put list of Fillers into templateVars and passs that into home.html
Use jinja to do a script loop to create all the markers, and be clickable

Problem is js --> python, not python --> html
